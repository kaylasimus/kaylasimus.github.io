## Guess the Number Game
Game where the player guesses a random number between 1-10.

- The player must pick a number between 1-10 to see if they can pick the same number as the code.
- Each attempt will generate a different number, the goal is to see how many times the player can guess the same generated number as the code.
  - I unfortunately couldn't figure out how to allow the player to keep guessing until the right number is guessed in one loop, so each loop generates a different number.
- There will be a score tracker to keep track of how many times the user was able to sync their number guess with the code.
- Image changes depending on if the user guesses the number right or wrong.
- Output displays if guess is higher or lower than the generated number.

- Basic Features: Random number generation, input form, feedback (higher/lower).
- Later proper directions that each guess is a differnt number, let's see how many times you're willing to try thinking of the same number!

- Enhanced Features: Score tracking, limited attempts, hint system.

- Advanced Features: Leaderboard with persistent storage, difficulty levels.
